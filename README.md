For more please refer the API documentation. Link is provided above.

The application uses local filesystem storage to manage files and integrates a simple API to handle file operations.


## Many more features could be added, which S3 provides, but due to time limitations, I could only add whatever was possible.

This project aims to showcase core functionalities of file management and integration using S3-like capabilities. While the current implementation covers essential features such as public/private bucket management and file operations, it is important to note that many additional advanced features provided by S3 could be included in future iterations.

Due to time constraints, only the most critical features have been implemented at this stage. Future updates may incorporate more comprehensive S3 functionalities to enhance the system's capabilities further.
